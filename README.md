# Bellabeat Marketing Analysis with R
## Intro

### This case study has been done as the Capstone Project in Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device fitness data to gain insights into how consumers are using these products. The insights I discover would then help guide the company's marketing strategy. 

### Bellabeat is a real company, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Even though they are a successful small company, they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

## Methodology

### For this project, crowd-sourced data from Fitbit was used. Fitbit is an American consumer electronics and fitness company that produces wireless-enabled wearable technology, physical fitness monitors, and activity trackers. The datasets I used included exercise activity and sleep records of thirty eligible Fitbit users that consented to share their personal data. 

### I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the data using RStudio. After that, I  created data visualizations using ggplot (R's well-known package) to create bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots which were then included in this presentation. 

### My goal was to improve Bellabeat's marketing strategy in order to increase its sales in the smart device industry. Key stakeholders included Urška Sršen (Bellabeat’s Co-Founder and CCO), Sando Mur (Co-Founder and key member of the executive team), and the Marketing Analytics Team, which was my direct stakeholder.
