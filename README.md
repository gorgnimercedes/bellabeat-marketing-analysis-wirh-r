# Bellabeat Marketing Analysis with R
## This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

### Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

### I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide the company's marketing strategy. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

### The business task is to solve Bellabeat's problem of improving its marketing strategy to increase its sales in the smart device industry. Key stakeholders include the Marketing Team, Mur and Srsen. My direct stakeholder is the Marketing Team.

### For this case study, I used the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, a public data set published by Mobius in Kaggle. I then cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the data by using R programming language. I also created data visualizations by using RStudio.
