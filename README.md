# Bellabeat Marketing Analysis with R
## This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

### Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. They are considered a successful small company and they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 

### I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insights into how consumers are using their smart devices. The results I obtained would then help guide the company's marketing strategy. I also had to create a presentation to showcase the results of my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

### For this case study, I used the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data, a public data set published by Mobius in Kaggle. I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed the data by using R programming language. I also created data visualizations by using RStudio.
